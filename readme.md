# Project Overview

This project was completed in Jupyter Notebook with Python, Pandas, Plotly and NumPy. The project was focused on RFM analysis for Starbucks, RFM standing for recency (how recently a customer made a purchase), frequency (how often a customer made a purchase), and monetary (how much money a customer spent). It mainly focused on frequency and how Starbucks could get customers who use the app to purchase more often. Through analysis, we needed to find out who the marketing team should be targeting and what kind of deals would improve their frequency metrics. A list of tasks that I completed in this project include:

- Set up an aggregation dictionary and applied it to the data frame to calculate the frequency and monetary metrics
- Performed a join to import the recency data into the data frame
- Performed data cleaning by dropping redundant columns and renaming other columns for clarity
- Created a function that used a conditional statement to assign frequency grades to customers based on their number of purchases
- Utilized Plotly to create a bar chart of frequency grades, allowing for easier analysis of grade distribution
- Provided a data-driven business recommendation on specific deals and promotions Starbucks can do to improve the frequency of customer purchases
